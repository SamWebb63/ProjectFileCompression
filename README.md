# ProjectFileCompression

This program features two forms of compression: Huffman and LZW. SchubsH.java uses Huffman while SchubsL.java uses LZW. Finally Deschubs takes both files and decompresses both of them.

# Huffman and LZW
LZW is a very commonly used compression algorithm that is normally used with .gif compressions. On the other hand, Huffman predicts the repeated usage of characters and assigns binary value to those characters based on how often they're used. So, the characters that are used most often have a shorter binary value in comparison to a character that is used less frequentyly. Both have their strenghts and weaknesses but both are very powerful and very useful.

# How to run and test

1) Download this repository
2) Save the file wherever you like and uncompress the folder
3) Go to the command prompt and navigate to where the folder is
4) Compile with the command: mvn compile
5) Execute with the command: mvn test
