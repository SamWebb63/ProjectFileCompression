# ProjectFileCompression

This program features two forms of compression: Huffman and LZW. SchubsH.java uses Huffman while SchubsL.java uses LZW. Finally Deschubs takes both files and decompresses both of them. LZW is a very commonly used compression algorithm that is normally used with .gif compressions. On the other hand, Huffman predicts the repeated usage of characters and assigns binary value to those characters based on how often they're used. So, the characters that are used most often have a shorter binary value in comparison to a character that is used less frequentyly. Both have their strenghts and weaknesses but both are very powerful and very useful.

# How to run and test
